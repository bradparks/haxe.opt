This wiki exposes the latest knowledge about how to optimize your haxe code.

All contributions are welcome as long as they follow the guidelines.


Guidelines : 
- One page per hint
- The document layout is yet to be standardized
- Every page should include a self contained test + timing.
- Whenever possible these test should have a try.haxe.org link that shows the problem and the timing difference.

How to benchmark :
-The tested data should be randomized if the optimization is not about static contents.
